# 🚀 Databricks Hands‑On Labs – Complete Beginner to Advanced Series

### **Author:  Sandeep Kumar Sharma**

Welcome to the **Databricks Hands‑On Labs Repository** — a fully structured, step‑by‑step practical learning path designed for beginners, intermediate engineers, and professionals who want to master **Apache Spark, Databricks, Delta Lake, Auto Loader, Unity Catalog, ADF Integrations, and real‑world data engineering workflows**.

This repository contains **production‑friendly, instructor‑style labs**, written in a natural classroom‑training tone. Every lab is designed the same way you would learn inside a real corporate session — clear explanations, real‑life examples, notes, validations, and complete hands‑on tasks.

# 🌟 Why This Repository?

Most Databricks tutorials only cover demos. But real‑world data engineering requires:

* Production‑grade ETL pipelines
* Delta Lake best practices
* Auto Loader & schema evolution
* Window functions
* Date handling
* ADF + Databricks integrations
* RBAC, security, identity & access control
* Development + troubleshooting patterns

This repository bridges that exact gap.

Here, you’ll learn Databricks **exactly as if you are attending a structured 40‑hour corporate workshop**, with all labs ready to run.
